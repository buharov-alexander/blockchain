# Blockchain
Study project to implement a simple blockchain prototype.

Blockchain has a simple interpretation: it's just a chain of blocks. It represents a sequence of data that you can't break in the middle; you can only append new data at the end of it. All the blocks in the blockchain are chained together.

Implementation can be split to the next stages:
* [Stage 1: The simplest blockchain](./docs/stages/stage_1.md)
* [Stage 2: A proof of work concept](./docs/stages/stage_2.md)
* [Stage 3: Miners and mining complexity](./docs/stages/stage_3.md)
* Stage 4: Storing data in the blocks
* Stage 5: Secure messages creation
* Stage 6: Transactions and cryptocurrencies
